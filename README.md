Historical Society to Close Library
The board of the New-York Historical Society voted yesterday to shut down the institution's library on
Feb. 19. All public programs are to be canceled, with the exception of a traveling show of 90 Audubon
watercolors that had long been planned, and 41 staff members will be dismissed; a skeleton crew of 35 will
be left to handle security, conservation and disposition of the collections.
NEW YORK TIMES, FEB. 4, 1993
To many people, the news was a shock. Following the closing of the Society's museum just five weeks
before, the shutting of the library was tantamount to a for-proft business's filing for bankruptcy protection.
Hard as it was to believe, the Society's museum and library holdings, arguably the single greatest collection
of materials documenting early American and New York life, were at risk of being broken up and dispersed.
Reaction to the news was swift and unanimous. Six hundred scholars at forty campuses across the nation
signed a petition urging New York's city and state offcials to "keep the collections intact and available to
New Yorkers." The New York Times ran an editorial calling for "responsible stewardship of so irreplaceable
a part of the city's 'memory.'" And New York's governor, Mario Cuomo ![Branching](Governor_Mario_Cuomo.jpg)
issued a statement in support of the Society, calling it "a vital part of the cultural heritage of New York State."
Founded in 1804 to collect and preserve materials relating to the early history of New York and the United
States, The New-York Historical Society is home to one of the nation's most distinguished research libraries.
Its collections include approximately eight hundred thousand volumes and more than three million manuscripts, maps, photographs, prints, and architectural drawings that collectively provide an unparalleled
picture of the early history of New York. But it is not just a library. The Society's museum is New
York's oldest, predating the founding of the Metropolitan Museum of Art by nearly seventy years. The
art holdings have grown to a collection of over 1.6 million objects, including world-renowned Hudson River
School paintings, an extensive collection of Tiffany glasswork, and 433 of the 435 original watercolors used
for John J. Audubon's classic work, Birds of America.
With such highly esteemed collections and seemingly broad support, how could the Society be in such
trouble? Although the answer to that question is complexindeed, searching for answers to it is the central
purpose of this book-the catalyst for the Society's crisis was really quite simple. After many years of
operating deffcits that had eroded the Society's capital base, there were insufficient fungible resources to
pay the day-to-day operating costs of the institution. In other words, the Society had run out of cash.
Generating cash and, more important, recurring cash flow would be essential if the Society was to survive. A
special advisory committee, which included prestigious specialists adept at turning around troubled for-profit
companies, was assembled to evaluate alternatives and to try to craft a workable solution.
The outcry that had led to the appointment of the advisory committee was "public" in every respect, and
articles appeared in the New York press that attempted to explain the reasons for the Society's problems.
In general, these articles emphasized the Society's reputation as an elitist institution, its inability to engage
both its surrounding community and the general public in its collections and programs, and the magnitude
of its financial difficulties. A New York Times article headlined "Is This the End for New York's Attic?" laid
much of the blame on the Society's board of trustees, describing a "depressing saga of crisis management."
It emphasized the erosion of the Society's endowment in the 1980s and the failure of trustees and administrators
to focus on an attainable mission. The article asserted that the Society's "mission statement was so vague
that it could serve for the Smithsonian Institution" and pointed out that one of the key tasks for the advisory
committee was to "accomplish in the next several weeks what the trustees did not when there was time: to
articulate, once and for all, a clear mission for the Society."
There were disparaging articles in other papers as well. An article in the New York Observer, headlined
"New-York Historical Society Rattling Toward Disintegration," was particularly critical of Society management.3
It asserted that during the late 1980s, the Society "continued to wrack up annual deffcits of $2
million a year and . . . had to 'invade' the ... relatively small endowment to cover expenses." It quoted an
unnamed member of the advisory committee, who wondered, "How can it be that year in and year out they
were dissipating the endowment without any sign of improvement? It makes you wonder what was going
on."
